One of Backbone's favorite clients, Parby Warker, has 3 new products:

{id : 1, name: “Turtoise Frame”, code: “PW1689”, price: 99.00, creator: “Jon Snow”, last_modified: 1538359384 }, 

{id: 2, name: “Aviator Sunglasses”, code: “PW134E”, price: 74:00, creator: “Samwell Tarly”, last_modified: 153316800}, 

{id: 3, name: “Igneous Matte”, code: “PW001Z”, price: 64.00, creator: “Arya Stark”, last_modified: 1566604800}

Configure an API that allows us to:
1. Fetch these products
2. Update their price
3. Delete an item. 

This data does not need to persist (no need for database). Add the appropriate UI for rendering these items as seen below. Please add the ability to edit prices within the UI, as well as UI for deleting an item - integrating with the API that you have created.
